# Week 1
## Spreadsheet Design and Structure

**Spreadsheet Design Principles**
* Rename sheet name
* select one column -> move and shift right & move
* `Format Cells` -> `Alignment` -> `Center Across Selection` (it seems like merged but still maintain each individual cell)
* `Ctrl + T` -> Tick `My table has headers`
* Name your table: `tbl_sales` - distinguish from named ranges
* Create a new sheet `Lookup`
* 1-to-1 correspondence between lookup value & return value
* `remove duplicates`
* named ranges give us responsiveness we are looking for
* `Formulas` -> `Create from Selection` -> `Top row` ==> you got `Region` & `Surburb` named ranges
* Then create `tbl_surburbs`
* Create a new sheet `Report`
