# Week 2
## Advanced Formula Techniques

**Introduction**
* Structured references in tables, array formulas, perform complex calculations
* Excel can:
	* Streamline workflows
	* Perform multiple calculations	
	* Reduce file sizes
* Will learn:
	* Structured references
	* Sort data with functions
	* array formulas
	* array functions

**Discussion**
* structured references - dynamic, automatically pick up those new values
* named ranges - refer to them by name, pros: don't need to go & select data
* array formulas - CSE formulas `CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER`
	* perform calc on multiple values in an array
