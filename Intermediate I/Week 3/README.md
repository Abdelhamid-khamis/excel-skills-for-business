# Week 3
## Named Ranges

**Introducing Named Ranges**
* refer data by name rather than cell reference
* Excel automatically uses relative referencing
* So, use `F4` make sure the excel don't move the call, make the value absolute/fixed - absolute cell references
* Instead of using `Absolute Cell Reference`, we can use `Named Ranges`

* A named range automatically gives us that absolute cell reference.
* EXP2017 which is just like E27, and is thus a cell reference which is not allowed to name a range.
