# Week 3
## Named Ranges

**Introducing Named Ranges**
* refer data by name rather than cell reference
* Excel automatically uses relative referencing
* So, use `F4` make sure the excel don't move the call, make the value absolute/fixed - absolute cell references
* Instead of using `Absolute Cell Reference`, we can use `Named Ranges`

* A named range automatically gives us that absolute cell reference.
* EXP2017 which is just like E27, and is thus a cell reference which is not allowed to name a range.
* create a single cell using name box

**Creating Named Ranges*** 
* `CTRL + SHIFT + DOWN`
* Scope - define where this named range can be seen
* `Create from Selection` - name multiple ranges simultaneaously
* `Name Box`, `Define Names`, `Create from Selection`
* `Create from Selection`
