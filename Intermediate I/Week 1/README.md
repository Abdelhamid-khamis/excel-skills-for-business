* Once you have linked workbooks, you need to ensure that they stay in their original location otherwise the links will not be able to update. If the files do move, then you can update the links to the new location.
* Linking workbooks allows us to create formulas that draw on values contained in other workbooks.

**Consolidating by Position**
* Once you setup consolidation, it actually remembers it
* If you change values in one of the workbooks, you need to rerun Consolidation

* You cannot undo Consolidation with Links.
* When you are linking to a data source, the "Create link to data source" check box should be ticked in Consolidate dialog box.
* The Consolidate feature has a whole range of functions that you can use.
